##Two-Mode LED Fader

###Fading Mode
Default mode. When fading, LED cycles through randomly selected colors at 5 second intervals. Color transitions are stepped for smooth fading. Current color can be paused by pressing a button which switches the device into Static Mode.

###Static Mode
When in static mode, LED holds on a single color. Pre-selected colors can be cycled through with a button press. A long press (0.5s) will return the device to Fading Mode.

######The only flaw I can currently see with the device is that the button cannot be read while the LED is stepping from one color to another. Changing from Fading Mode to Static Mode can only be done once the color fading is complete. A complete fade cycle usually takes no longer than one second.
